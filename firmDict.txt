0x8a03000a	amg_10_NOTICE	amg	10	INFO	CLUSTER	One of the jobs of the Amg, as it was initially conceived, is to filter out redundant notifications (originating with the back end Fibre Channel software) of the appearance and disappearance of storage volumes. This is because all directors find out about those happenings, and having all directors broadcast each to all other directors is too many messages. So, each sends a notification to the "master" Amg director, and that director filters them. This event will be produced whenever a director sees the appearance of a storage volume that it already knows about. Typically, this will be because it has found out about the storage volume because of the initial state given to it by some other Amg director. This is should not be a problem - just a small timing window. [storageVolumeId] is the logical unit identifier of the storage volume.

If that spare pool no longer exists, the Amg will attempt to re-create it. If it cannot do so, because its space for spare pools is exhausted, it will instead simply put the storage volume into the default spare pool. This event indicates that that has happened. [oldPoolId] is the id of the spare pool as indicated by the storage volume, [storageVolumeId] is the logical unit id of the storage volume, [newPoolName] is the name of the spare pool that the storage volume was actually put into, and [newPoolId] is the new pool's 64-bit unique id.

However, I believe that all directors currently go and do it.

0x8a2b3016	rmg_22_WARNING	rmg	22	WARNING	CLUSTER	Introducing event rmg/21 created a bug. If none of the directors that are members of a replication group have booted when other directors are reading their flash for replication settings, then that group will not have been created yet in the Rmg data structures. Thus, event rmg/21 would have triggered, and those replication settings were ignored. This could happen simply based on the timing of director boots. So, rmg/21 is no longer done. Intead, you can now delete a replication group that has invalid replication settings referencing it - those invalid settings will be deleted first, automatically. For each one so deleted, new event rmg/22 is produced. More detail on this one provided by cg: Normally, you can't delete an Rmg group if there are still some replication settings that reference that group as source or target. However, we got into situations where the directors that are members of a group had not booted (e.g. were dead, or were now in a different city....) So, the towers didn't actually know about the group. But, there could have been replication settings stored on other live directors that reference the group. Those settings are invalid, in that they reference an unknown group. Also, they have no effect, since none of the directors in the group are present. So, back in the time of rmg/21, the Rmg code would automatically delete those replication settings as they were read from flash. But, the lack of any directors that are in the "bad" group could have just been an odd-ball bootup timing thing, and that Rmg group would become valid in a few seconds. So, having automatically deleted what we thought were bad replication settings was a bad thing. (I think that process was actually requested by some SPR, since the rule about not being able to delete a group with active settings referencing it meant that a truely bad group could never be deleted.) So, the resolution of not wanting to delete bad settings, but still wanting to be able to get rid of truely bad Rmg groups, required another fix. That fix was to let the user delete the "bad" Rmg group, but, at that time, to automatically delete any replication settings that reference the group. For each such setting deleted, new event rmg/22 is emitted, to show the details of the setting that is being deleted.

RTT_TOO_BIG: the path might be congested, when the congestion resolves, the degrade condition will resolve by itself; If the path does have longer RTT compare to the other path, then it will not be used unless it is the last usable path. 2).  IO_ERROR: some IO error will trigger this condition, these IO errors are usually caused by a faulty hardware on the IO path. Try to identify the common point of failure and remove the faulty condition. The condition will be removed if no more IO error was noticed for a while. 3). LINK_FLAP: the link had been flapping too often, fix the hardware issue caused the flapping and the condition will be resolved.	Contact EMC support.
